## ðŸ’¬ How Auto-Scroll is Implemented

After each new message is added, the chat automatically scrolls to the newest message.

This is achieved using:

- `useRef` to reference the last message element.
- `useEffect` to call `.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })` whenever the list of messages changes.

## ðŸ›  Why Zustand Was Chosen

- Simplicity: Zustand has a minimalistic API and is much easier to set up compared to Redux.

- No Boilerplate: Unlike Redux, Zustand requires no reducers, action types, or complex configuration.

- Performance: Zustand updates only the components that use specific slices of the state, leading to better performance.

- Built-in LocalStorage Support: Zustand can easily persist state (like chat history) into local storage.

- Lightweight: Zustand is a small library (around 1KB gzipped), making it ideal for simple apps like a chat.
